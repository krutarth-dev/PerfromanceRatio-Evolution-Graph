# PerfromanceRatio-Evolution-Graph
The Goal of this short assignment was to replicate a graph which shows the evolution of performance ratio over the years.


-	The red line on the graph represents the 30-d moving average of the PR (Performance Evolution) whereas the scatter points depict the GHI. 

-	The dark green line represents the budget line. The value begins from 73.9 and should reduce by 0.8% every year (Do not hardcode the values). As you can see the, the values are:

o	73.9 for the first year (July 2019 to June 2020)
o	73.3 for the second year (July 2020 to June 2021)
o	72.7 for the third year (July 2021 to present)

-	The points for the scatter plot are colour coded (as per the legend above). That is: if the GHI [Daily Irradiation] is:

o	Less than 2: Navy blue
o	2-4: Light blue
o	4-6: Orange
o	>6: Brown

-	The points above Target Budget PR represent the number of PR points above the Budget PR for that particular year.

-	The bottom right section of the graph simply shows the average PR for the last 7 days, the last 30 days, last 60 days and so on.
